#+title: TDD Scratch

* TDD Directives and scope
 - I'm working an SSE MCP Server that exposes Resources, Tools and Prompts over a karpor storage : my testing scope is limited to that and don't have to mock or write tests for anything else in this phase of TDD
 - when we iterate over the phases of TDD:
   - enlisting tests for a behaviour
   - choosing one and passing the test
   - refactoring
   - iterating until needed, adding more tests as required
 - keep in mind to not cross this scope for now. we'll simply take note if test coverage/design is missing for other components and take it up in separate dedicated phases
