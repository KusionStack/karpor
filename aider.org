* Code Specifics
** hack
  The `hack` directory contains scripts and tools for automating development tasks, code generation, and verification.
  - **Code Generation:** Scripts (`update-codegen.sh`, `generate-groups.sh`, `generate-internal-groups.sh`) generate Go code for Kubernetes-style APIs (deepcopy, clientsets, listers, informers, defaulters, conversions, openapi). Uses tools from `tools.go` and boilerplate headers.
  - **Code Verification:** `verify-codegen.sh` checks if generated code is up-to-date.
  - **CLI Documentation Generation:** `gen-cli-docs/main.go` generates Markdown documentation for Karpor CLI commands.
  - **Utility Functions:** `util.sh` provides helper functions like setting up a temporary GOPATH.

* Plan
** Phase 1: Core mcp-go Integration with Elasticsearch (Basic Resource)
*** Goal: Get a minimal MCP SSE server running that exposes one type of resource fetched from Elasticsearch.
*** Study:
**** Deeply understand the `mcp-go` library:
***** Focus on `mcp.Server`, `server.SSEServer`.
***** Understand the `mcp.Resource`, `mcp.Tool`, `mcp.Prompt` interfaces and how they are registered and used by the server.
***** Review `mcp-go` examples if available.
**** Review Karpor's Elasticsearch storage implementation (`pkg/infra/search/storage/elasticsearch`):
***** How are resources queried and retrieved?
***** What is the structure of stored data?
**** Analyze Karpor's core entity structures (`pkg/core/entity`):
***** Choose one simple entity (e.g., `ResourceGroup`) to expose first.
**** Re-read Issue #658 and Discussion #675 for specific requirements or use cases.
**** Review the current state of PR #798.
*** Design:
**** Refine the `pkg/mcp` package structure.
**** Design a struct that implements the `mcp.Resource` interface for the chosen Karpor entity (e.g., `ResourceGroup`). This struct will need access to the Elasticsearch storage client.
**** Determine how to map Karpor's entity data to the structure expected by the `mcp.Resource` interface methods (e.g., `List`, `Get`).
**** Outline the necessary modifications in `pkg/mcp/server.go` to initialize the `mcp-go` server and register the implemented `mcp.Resource`.
**** Plan the final integration steps in `cmd/karpor/app/mcp.go` to create the storage client, create the `MCPStorageServer`, and start it.
*** Programming:
**** Implement the `mcp.Resource` interface methods (`List`, `Get`, etc.) in a new file/struct within `pkg/mcp` (e.g., `pkg/mcp/resourcegroup.go`).
***** Inside these methods, use the Karpor Elasticsearch storage client to fetch data.
***** Handle potential errors from the storage layer.
**** Update `pkg/mcp/server.go`:
***** Modify `NewMCPStorageServer` to accept and store the `storage.Storage` interface.
***** Add a method (e.g., `RegisterResources`) to register the implemented `mcp.Resource` instances with the internal `mcpServer`.
**** Update `cmd/karpor/app/mcp.go`:
***** After initializing the Elasticsearch storage, call the registration method on the `MCPStorageServer` instance before calling `Serve`.
***** Ensure proper context propagation and error handling during server startup.
***** Add basic logging using the configured `klogr` logger.
***** Address any linter warnings (`nolint` comments should be reviewed).
*** Testing:
**** Write unit tests for the `mcp.Resource` implementation, mocking the storage backend.
**** Write integration tests for the server startup and the basic resource listing endpoint.
**** Manual testing: Run the `karpor mcp` command and use a tool (like `curl` or a simple client) to connect to the SSE endpoint and verify that resource events are received.
*** Other:
**** Ensure `go.mod` and `go.sum` are clean and correct.
**** Set up a local Elasticsearch instance for testing if not already available.

** Phase 2: Expanding Resource Coverage & Basic Tools/Prompts (Elasticsearch)
*** Goal: Expose more Karpor entities as MCP Resources and implement basic MCP Tools and Prompts interacting with Elasticsearch data.
*** Study:
**** Identify other critical Karpor entities to expose (e.g., `ResourceGroupRule`).
**** Understand the `mcp.Tool` and `mcp.Prompt` interfaces in detail.
**** How can Karpor's existing logic (e.g., AI manager) be integrated via the `mcp.Prompt` interface?
*** Design:
**** Design implementations for additional `mcp.Resource` types.
**** Design one or two simple `mcp.Tool` implementations (e.g., an action related to a resource).
**** Design one or two simple `mcp.Prompt` implementations (e.g., asking a question about a resource group count).
**** Plan how these new implementations will be registered with the `mcp-go` server.
*** Programming:
**** Implement `mcp.Resource` for additional entities.
**** Implement `mcp.Tool` for selected actions, interacting with storage or other Karpor managers as needed.
**** Implement `mcp.Prompt` for selected AI interactions, integrating with Karpor's AI manager if applicable.
**** Update `pkg/mcp/server.go` to register these new Resources, Tools, and Prompts.
**** Write unit tests for all new implementations.
*** Testing:
**** Write integration tests for the new Resources, Tools, and Prompts.
**** Manual testing of all exposed capabilities.

** Phase 3: Etcd Integration (If Required)
*** Goal: Integrate Etcd as a potential data source for MCP, if Karpor uses Etcd for data relevant to MCP.
*** Study:
**** Determine if Karpor currently uses Etcd for data that should be exposed via MCP.
**** If so, understand Karpor's Etcd client and data structures.
**** How can `mcp-go` interfaces (`Resource`, `Tool`, `Prompt`) be implemented using Etcd as a backend?
*** Design:
**** Design Etcd-specific implementations of `mcp.Resource`, `mcp.Tool`, `mcp.Prompt` if the data source requires it.
**** Plan how the server setup will handle potentially multiple storage backends (Elasticsearch and Etcd).
*** Programming:
**** Implement Etcd-backed MCP interfaces.
**** Update server registration logic to include Etcd-backed components.
**** Write unit tests.
*** Testing:
**** Write integration tests for Etcd-backed features.
**** Manual testing with Etcd backend.

** Phase 4: Refinement, Comprehensive Testing, and Documentation
*** Goal: Ensure the MCP server is robust, well-tested, and documented.
*** Programming:
**** Conduct thorough code reviews.
**** Refactor code for clarity, maintainability, and performance.
**** Improve error handling, logging, and metrics (if needed).
**** Address any remaining linter issues.
*** Testing:
**** Run the full suite of unit, integration, and potentially end-to-end tests.
**** Performance testing if necessary.
**** Address any bugs found.
*** Documentation:
**** Document the MCP server's purpose, configuration options, and how to run it.
**** Document the specific Resources, Tools, and Prompts exposed by the Karpor MCP server.
**** Update relevant READMEs and Karpor documentation.
*** Other:
**** Prepare the changes for merging (squash commits, write clear commit messages).
**** Coordinate with team for final review and merge.

* Misc Notes
** Leverage existing natural language search mechanism
** karpor mcp is a separate command just like syncer
 - is init by executing karpor mcp : starts the mcp server
* Misc TODO
 - [ ] get a basic `karpor mcp` server running
* Aider Directives
** TDD : Test Driven Development
 - https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TestDrivenDevelopment.html
 - testify for unit tests
 - ginkgo and gomega for integration and end to end tests

* TDD Scratch pad
 - need to catch up on tests
 - testify for unit tests and ginkgo, gomega for the integration and end to end tests
 - my scope can all be restricted to karpor mcp working right
 - I don't need to check the functionality of cobra or viper working well but need to restrict myself to the specifics of mcp-go and  how it fits
