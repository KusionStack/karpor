# karbour Quick Start Guide

This guide will walk you through the installation process of karbour, a cloud-native multi-cluster search and insights software. The installation process consists of three steps: creating a cluster using kind, installing karbour's manifest. Finally, you can access karbour's dashboard.

## Prerequisites

* Ensure [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) is installed.
* Ensure [helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) is installed.
* Ensure [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/#installation/) is installed for local testing.

## Step 1: Create Cluster

First, you need to create a Kubernetes cluster in your local environment. We will use the `kind` tool to create the cluster. Follow these steps:

1. Create a cluster. You can create a cluster named karbour-cluster using the following command:
   ```shell
   kind create cluster --name karbour-cluster
   ```
   This will create a new Kubernetes cluster in your local Docker environment. Wait for a moment until the cluster creation is complete.
2. Verify that the cluster is running properly by executing the command:
   ```shell
   kubectl cluster-info
   ```
   If everything is set up correctly, you'll see information about your Kubernetes cluster.

## Step 2: Install karbour

After creating the cluster, proceed with the installation of karbour:
1. Clone the Karbour project using git and navigate to the charts/karbour directory:
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/KusionStack/karbour.git
   cd charts
   ```
2. Run the following command to install Karbour using Helm:
   ```shell
   helm install karbour ./karbour
   ```
3. Wait for the installation of karbour to complete. You can check the status of karbour installation by running the following command:
   ```shell
   kubectl get pods -n karbour
   ```
   When all the karbour pods are in the Running state, it means the installation is complete.

## Step 3: Access karbour Dashboard

1. Run the following command to forward the karbour server port:
   ```shell
   kubectl -n karbour port-forward service/karbour-server 7443:7443
   ```
   This will create a port forward from your local machine to the karbour server.
2. Open your browser and enter the following URL:
   ```shell
   https://127.0.0.1:7443
   ```
   This will take you to the karbour dashboard.

Congratulations! You have successfully installed karbour. Now you can start using karbour for multi-cluster search and insights.
