You can pick up any of the following ways you're interested to contribute.

## Contribute Use cases and Samples

* If you are interested, you can also write a [karpor.com blog](https://karpor.com/blog) to tell more about the use case.
* You can also contribute to [Karpor Official Samples](https://github.com/KusionStack/samples).

## Report bugs

Before submitting a new issue, try to make sure someone hasn't already reported the problem.
Look through the [existing issues](https://github.com/KusionStack/karpor/issues) for similar issues.

Report a bug by submitting a [bug report](https://github.com/KusionStack/karpor/issues/new?assignees=&labels=kind%2Fbug&template=bug-report.yaml&title=).
Make sure that you provide as much information as possible on how to reproduce the bug.

Follow the issue template and add additional information that will help us replicate the problem.

### Security issues

If you believe you've found a security vulnerability, please read our [security policy](https://github.com/KusionStack/karpor/blob/main/SECURITY.md) for more details.

## Contribute to the Docs

Contributing to the docs needs to learn some knowledge about how to make a pull request to Github, I think this won't be hard if you follow the guide.
