You can contribute in any of the following ways that interest you.

## Contributing Use Cases and Demos

* If you are using Karpor, the simplest way to contribute is to [express gratitude to the community](https://github.com/KusionStack/karpor/issues/343).

## Reporting Bugs

Before submitting a new issue, please make sure that no one has already reported the problem.

Check the [Issue list](https://github.com/KusionStack/karpor/issues) for any similar issues.

[Report bugs](https://github.com/KusionStack/karpor/issues/new?assignees=&labels=kind%2Fbug&projects=&template=bug-report.yaml) by submitting a Bug report, ensuring you provide as much information as possible to help reproduce the Bug.

Follow the issue template and add additional information to help us replicate the issue.

## Security Issues

If you believe you have discovered a security vulnerability, please read our [security policy](https://github.com/KusionStack/karpor/blob/main/SECURITY.md) for more detailed information.

## Suggesting Enhancements

If you have ideas to improve Karpor, please submit a [feature request](https://github.com/KusionStack/karpor/issues/new?assignees=&labels=kind%2Ffeature&projects=&template=enhancement.yaml).

## Answering Questions

If you have a question and cannot find the answer in the [documentation](https://www.kusionstack.io/karpor/), the next step is to ask on [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/KusionStack/karpor/discussions).

Helping these users is important to us, and we would love to have your help. You can contribute by answering [their questions](https://github.com/KusionStack/karpor/discussions) to help other Karpor users.

## Contributing Documentation

Contributing to the documentation requires some knowledge on how to submit a pull request to Github, which I think won't be difficult if you follow the guide.

* [kusionstack.io Developer's Guide](https://github.com/KusionStack/kusionstack.io/blob/main/README.md)
