Look through the [existing issues](https://github.com/KusionStack/karbour/issues) for similar issues.

Report a bug by submitting a [bug report](https://github.com/KusionStack/karbour/issues/new?assignees=&labels=kind%2Fbug&template=bug-report.yaml&title=).
Make sure that you provide as much information as possible on how to reproduce the bug.

Follow the issue template and add additional information that will help us replicate the problem.

Contributing to the docs needs to learn some knowledge about how to make a pull request to Github, I think this won't be hard if you follow the guide.
